# Selfish-Mining-Simulator

## inportant terms in blockchain security

- Incentive compatible:
- Block race:
- Profit threshold: minimal ùõº for which employing dishonest mining strategies becomes profitable.
- Block propagation 
- Block withholding: 

## Markov Chain Model

### 1. Model 

*Reference: Majority is not Enough* ![link](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ie53/publications/btcProcFC.pdf)

### 2. Simulation

Comparing the result of simulation and theoritical result of simulation using ![selfish_mining_simulation.py](selfish_mining_simulation.py)

Simulation Result:

## Markov Decision Process Model

Reference: 

### A simple Upper bound for profit of Selfish Mining 

Consider an extreme case: If every block mined by the selfish miner could override one block of honest miner, the revenue of selfish miner would be:
$ \alpha $

This is an upper bound for profit of selfish mining.

### construct the MDP model for Selfish Mining
